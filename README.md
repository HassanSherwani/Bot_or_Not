# Bot_or_Not

Build an optimal model that can help us identify bot traffic coming from search engines i.e non-human traffic(NHT) and human traffic (HT).

# Content

1- EDA.ipynb (This notebook contains how data has been explored and cleaned)

2- ML_Model.ipynb( This notebook implements couple of machine learning algorithms and then choose most optimal based on problem statement, assumptions, and evaluation matrics)

3- Model_Tuning_Decsion_Tree.ipynb(This notebook applied hyper parameter methods to improve model. Also it evaluates model on different matrics)

4)- report.pdf: One document to describe my assumptions and key findings out of case study.
